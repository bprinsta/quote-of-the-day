# Quote of the Day

This iOS application delivers you daily inspirational quotes about love, life, art, business and much more. Within the app, users can save and share their favorite quotes, as well as read about the quote's authors. I built this application because I wanted to gain experience handling network calls and using CoreData with an iOS application. I also thought this app would be a good opportunity to create a beautiful user interface and increase my design skills.
